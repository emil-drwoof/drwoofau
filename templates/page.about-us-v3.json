We asked ourselves a simple question. Why does the gear look so tired when the people wearing it give so much?\n<br><br>\nWe did not want to create another ordinary uniform. We wanted to build something that felt good in every way. Something medically comfortable. Something that brought joy, personality, and humanity into healthcare.<br><br>\nSo we started designing from the inside out. First came bamboo rich compression socks engineered for real comfort. Then came scrubs built to stretch, breathe, and move. Every product had to pass what we called the twelve hour shift test. If it did not feel exceptional during a real shift, we went back to the drawing board."
