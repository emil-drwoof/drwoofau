The people who show up for others, day after day.<br><br>\nWe design functional, joyful apparel made for long shifts, real movement, and real humans. We believe workwear can be practical and still bring a bit of warmth, personality, and lightness into demanding days.<br><br>\nSome of us have worked in healthcare ourselves, and we see that lived experience as a huge bonus. But it’s not a requirement. What matters most is that you care about the people we serve and genuinely want to help the helpers.<br><br>\nWe’re a small team that values empathy, ownership, and doing things properly. No corporate layers, no ego, no pretending. Just people who take pride in their work and want it to mean something.<br><br>\nIf you’re excited by building a thoughtful brand, enjoy working closely with others, and want your work to have a positive impact on the medical world, we’d love to hear from you.\nLet’s build something meaningful together.<br><br>\n\n<b>You don’t need to be in healthcare to work here. You just need to care about the people who are.<\/b>"
